I built [Mood Industries](https://github.com/moodindustries), a music discovery app that served underground music to 1000s of people, was a full-stack developer at [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/), led a team at [Dovly](https://www.dovly.com/) to build an app with a unique approach to help people supercharge their credit score.

I also love playing guitar, latin dancing, and cooking.
