## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Luis!

And I like to build useful things.

I built [Mood Industries](https://github.com/moodindustries), a music discovery app that served underground music to 1000s of people, was a full-stack developer at [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/), and led a team at [Dovly](https://www.dovly.com/) to build an app with a unique approach to help people supercharge their credit score.

Then, I worked on a few Ethereum projects pseudonymously as [0xTARC](https://github.com/0xtarc), though I now work under my own name. Notably, I worked on [FiatDAO](https://github.com/fiatdao), and am now building perpetual options at [Panoptic](https://github.com/panoptic-labs).

I also love playing guitar, latin dancing, and cooking.
