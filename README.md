## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Luis!

I'm a full stack developer who likes to build cool stuff with great people.

I built [Mood Industries](https://github.com/moodindustries), a music discovery app that served underground music to 1000s of people, was a full-stack developer at [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/), led a team at (Dovly)[https://www.dovly.com/] to build an app with a unique approach to help people supercharge their credit score.

Random side projects in between of course. See https://whoislewys.com for more on me if you're curios

I also love playing guitar, latin dancing, and cooking.
